## Description

Duck Jump is a vertical 2D platforming video game, intended to be played on android phones. The goal is to bounce your duck to the top of the map while collecting as many coins as possible. The game will begin by pressing play and the duck will jump off of the floor of the map up to the first level of platforms, from here on the user is in control of their duck trying to reach as high as possible without falling. During gameplay the duck will jump vertically after coming into contact with a platform. The user interacts with the game by swiping left and right controlling where the duck is jumping with the goal being to touch another platform so that they can jump higher. The user wins by reaching the top of the map, and loses by missing a platform and falling down. At the end of the game the user's score will be displayed and they can press play to play again.
